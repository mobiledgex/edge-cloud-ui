# MobiledgeX UI Console

Using the MobiledgeX Edge-Cloud platform, telco operators can utilize their own telco network edge infrastructure to create — and monetize — their own edge clouds. These edge clouds can then be used for internal operator workloads, or leveraged by developers to run their applications on telco edge infrastructure.
