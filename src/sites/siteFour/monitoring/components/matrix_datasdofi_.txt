< Cloudlet>>
— utilization

    diskMax - Max available Disk size in GBs
    diskUsed - Disk used at a timestamp in GBs
    memMax - Max memory on this cloudlet in MBs
    memUsed - Memory used at timestamp in MBs
    vCpuMax - Max available number of vCPUs on this cloudlet
    vCpuUsed - Number vCPUs on this cloudlet at timestamp

—  ipusage

    floatingIpsMax - Max available number of floating IP addresses
    floatingIpsUsad -  Number floating IP addresses on this cloudlet at timestamp
    ipv4Max - Max available number of external IPv4 addresses
    ipv4Used - Number external IPv4 addresses on this cloudlet at timestamp

<<Cluster>>

    “cpu” example - CPU value is a percentage
    “mem” example - memory value is a percentage
    “disk” example - cluster filesystem utilization percentage
    “network” example - cluster tx/rx traffic rate in Bytes/sec averaged over 1 minute
    “tcp” example - total number of established TCP connections/TCP retransmissions in this cluster
    “udp” example - total number of rx/tx UDP datagrams inn this cluster and total number of UDP errors(additive)

<<App>>

    Below are the examples:
    “cpu” example - AppInst CPU usage for an app with 2 containers, CPU value is a percentage
    “mem” example - current memory footprint of a given AppInst in bytes
    “disk” example - filesystem usage for a given AppInst in bytes
    “network” example - AppInst tx/rx traffic rate in Bytes/sec averaged over 1 minute
    “connections” example - AppInst connection information by port; number of accepted, active, and handled connections, as well as total bytes sent/received, and a histogram of session times in ms. For example P50 is the 50th percentile in session time, in this example below 50% of all sessions lasted 6ms or less

<< Client >>

    Valid method names are: “RegisterClient”, “VerifyLocation”, “FindCloudlet”, “GetLocation”, “AppInstList”, “FqdnList”, “DynamicLocGroup”, “QosPosition”
    100ms, 10ms, 25ms, 50ms, 5ms - latency buckets for the API call RTT
    cellID - Cell Id of the tower where the API request came from, can be used in geolocation grouping
    err - number of errors returned for this AppInst, method, and cellID for this timestamp
    foundCloudlet - Cloudlet name that was returned as a result of this FindCloudlet api call
    foundOperator - Operator name that was returned as a result of this FindCloudlet api call
    id - hostname where DME is(Unused)
    inf - UNUSED
    method - one of “RegisterClient”, “VerifyLocation”, “FindCloudlet”, “GetLocation”, “AppInstList”, “FqdnList”, “DynamicLocGroup”, “QosPosition”
    oper - Operator name where the DME is
    reqs - number of requests sent since last collection
